from Product import Product
from ShoppingCart import ShoppingCart










#As a developer, I want to import the Customer and Product classes into main.py so I can instantiate a customer object as well as three Product objects and interact with the object’s methods:

# 1. Print the customer’s name to the terminal

# 2. Call the customer’s add product to shopping cart method three times and add the three products objects you created

# 3. Call the customer’s view products method

# 4. Call the customer’s shopping cart’s get cart total method. Capture the total the method returns in a variable and print to the terminal

# 5. Call the customer’s shopping cart’s empty cart method

# 6. Check if all products have been removed from the shopping cart
